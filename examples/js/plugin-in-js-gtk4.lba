# Gtk4 by concept doesn't want to obey to other app as it seems,
# it needs to just block some thread. That is why we actually have to
# evaluate our js script in a separate thread.. A good question is
# how will we access anything..
# If only we could init some things in our bombolla script, and then
# obtain them through gtk4 in js..

(create LbaGjs js)
